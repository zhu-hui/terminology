# terminology

* phoneme: (音素） (/ˈfoʊniːm/) is one of the units of sound (or gesture in the case of sign languages, see chereme) that distinguish one word from another in a particular language. In most dialects of English, the difference in meaning between the words kill /kɪl/ and kiss /kɪs/ is a result of the substitution of one phoneme, /l/, for another phoneme, /s/.

* syllable: (音节）is a unit of organization for a sequence of speech sounds.For example, the word water is composed of two syllables: wa and ter. A syllable is typically made up of a syllable nucleus (most often a vowel) with optional initial and final margins (typically, consonants).

* letter: A letter is a grapheme (written character) in an alphabetic system of writing, such as the Greek alphabet and its descendants. Letters also appear in abjads and abugidas (variants of alphabets in which vowel marking is secondary or absent). Letters broadly denote phonemes in the spoken form of the language, although there is rarely a consistent exact correspondence between letters and phonemes.

* likelihood: is a function of the parameters of a statistical model given data.

* maximum likelihood estimation (MLE): is a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model given observations, by finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of making the observations given the parameters.
